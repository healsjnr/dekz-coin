# Dekz Coin

Hottest ICO this year

## What is this?

Instead of a regular leaving gift we'll run an ICO for Jacob's gift. 

How it will work:

  1. We create a contract for a new token: _DekzCoin_ (`DKZ`)
  2. Any one who wants contribute will send ETH to this contract
  3. You will be rewarded with ~1000 DKZ per 10 AUD
  4. ICO ends 5th January. At showcase we transfer ownership to Jacob

The contract has a function called `stealAllTheMoney` which allows Jacob (and only Jacob) to take out all the funds. He'll also be credited with 1,000,000,000 DKZ

## What the hell can I do with DKZ

Nothing. Unlike other ICO this is 100% a scam and the token serves absolutely no purposes. Oh sorry, I mean unlike other ICOs we are actually telling you this. 

If someone wants to get this traded some where that would be awesome though. If they became worth something we'd have given Jacob one hell of a leaving gift.
