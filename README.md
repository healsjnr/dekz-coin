## Splash page thoughts

It would be awesome to get a splash page live. At the minimum it could have:
  - The contract Address
  - Instructions for participating using MetaMask / MEW
  - Start and end dates
  - Show a random message from the contract
  - Allow people to leave messages on the contract
  - Some awesomely bad web design, text, pictures of jacob superimposed on bitcoin. I dunno.

As a bonus:
  - Show current MM wallet dekz balance
  - Have a hiden div that only show's up if the current MM account is the contract's wallet account. This account has the ability to `steal` all the money, so we could have a button to allow jacob to do this.

## What is this?

Instead of a regular leaving gift we'll run an ICO for Jacob's gift. 

How it will work:

  1. We create a contract for a new token: _DekzCoin_ (`DKZ`)
  2. Any one who wants contribute will send ETH to this contract
  3. You will be rewarded with ~1000 DKZ per 10 AUD
  4. ICO ends 5th January. At showcase we transfer ownership to Jacob

The contract has a function called `stealAllTheMoney` which allows Jacob (and only Jacob) to take out all the funds. He'll also be credited with 1,000,000,000 DKZ

## What the hell can I do with DKZ

Nothing. Unlike other ICO this is 100% a scam and the token serves absolutely no purposes. Oh sorry, I mean unlike other ICOs we are actually telling you this. 

If someone wants to get this traded some where that would be awesome though. If they became worth something we'd have given Jacob one hell of a leaving gift.
